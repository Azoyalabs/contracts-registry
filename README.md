## Contracts listing

This repository holds the information for the Fetchstation app to list validated smart contracts, based on their code id.


## Contracts info

To add information on a new contract, you need to create a new entry in the JSON file for the appropriate network under the [records](/records) folder.

The content of the entry should be like this:

```JSON
{
    "6688": {
        "owner": "Azoyalabs",
        "website": "https://www.fetns.domains/"
    }
}
```
